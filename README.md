In this project we will be building w website from scratch that handles evryday operations
of the business that I, Anthony Tyler Kimble and his TEAM  is building together for Ace's Aerial Studio's. Hopefully
an leadind media platform here in tulsa soon. 

A few Functions as follows:
Home page- the Home page takes is main page of the website that the user will see when first 
opening to the web page.
Portfolio- This tab stores all the photos taken by any given deone oerator, must have permission by owner of photo
to post into the portflolio and the map.
Contact tab- This tab take cares of anybody who wants to schedule a appointment with the drone company.
Submission tab- this tab is an administative tab that takes the entries of the contact tab and stores them into 
the submissions and enters theminto our database where later an administator of the comapany can go back and check 
those submissions in order to get back into contcat with potential clients.
Map tab- this tab is espaecially special to me in a sense that i took hrs onto hrs getting this tabs api to implement into our code base.
The functionality of the tab comes down to the interactiveness of the map. So i created a search bar with the map so you can search for any place in the world.
secondily i cerated a pinpoint system that you can attach a photo to and from there the pin is displayed onto the map and you can visually veiw the photo from the location that you took that photo.
Thirdly i created street view with a creative way of intitallizing the  function. So i created this little character in the right hand of the sceen that you drag over the map
picking your location and from there you will go into street view. Its a pretty cool little concept in my opinion.
